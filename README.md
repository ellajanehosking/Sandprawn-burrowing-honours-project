# **Differences in sandprawn burrowing activity in response to changes in human recreation and bait harvesting in Langebaan Lagoon**

## Larger Project Summary
Human presence and Bait harvesting appear to be major stresses on sandprawns (*Kraussillichirus kraussi*). The study aims to evaluate the effect of these stressors on the sandprawn's burrowing activity.

This study will take place in Langebaan Lagoon, Western Cape, South Africa. It is a conservation area that is divided into zones of use. I will study Zone A, where human presence and bait harvesting are permitted. There is a gradient of human visitation. Most visitors occur at the start of zone A and almost no visitors are present at the end.

I will quantify the sandprawn respiration rate and burrowing rate. I will compare these variables between sites with maximum human activity and sites with minimal activity. The second component of the study aims to help us understand whether there is local adaptation to recreational activity. This involves a reciprocal translocation experiment whereby individual sandprawns are transferred between the sites and monitored. Sandprawns will be harvested with a cylindrical prawn pump and released after observation.
Data collection has not happened yet.

#### Variables:
1. Change in oxygen levels over time; measured with a respirometer. This is a proxy for Sandprawn respiration rate.
2. Sandprawn burrowing rate. This is the time taken for complete burial in the sand (seconds). 

#### Environmental Variables:
1. CTD measurements
2. Sediment porosity (*kg/cm<sup> 2* </sup>) measured by penetrometer.
3. Sediment oxygentation; approximated by sediment colouration. 
4. Visitor numbers; sampled via the scan-sampling method.

## Initial exploration
Initial exploration was done on dataset from a previous study that used the same sites. It is theorised that the difference in burrowing activity may effect the reproductive output of the sandprawns. Plots were produced from this dataset to compare the reproductive output between sandprawns across the gradient. 

#### Variables: 
1. Egg biomass (g)
2. Embryo number

#### Sites:
- Site 1 = maximum visitation
* Sites 2-4 = form the gradient of levels of visitation
+ Site 5 = minimum visitation
